# Copy this file to .env and fill in real values. NEVER commit .env (it is in .gitignore).
# If .env or Supabase keys were ever committed or exposed: revoke and rotate keys in
# Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → API, then put the new keys only in .env.

# Optional: no API keys required for the map (Leaflet + OpenStreetMap).

# Supabase — for shared community spots (post & see others' spots)
# Get these from https://supabase.com/dashboard → your project → Settings → API
