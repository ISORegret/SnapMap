# SnapMap landing site

This folder is deployed to GitHub Pages as the SnapMap marketing/launch page (PepTalk-style).

- **Deploy:** Push to `main`; the workflow uploads `website/` as the Pages artifact.
- **APK:** To make “Download APK” work, add `SnapMap.apk` into this folder (e.g. copy from `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk` and rename to `SnapMap.apk`), then commit and push.
